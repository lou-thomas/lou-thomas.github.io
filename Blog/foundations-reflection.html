            <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3> 
      </p>
      <p>
            I learnt about my personal motivations for meeting expectations. I’ve always struggled with procrastination to the extreme. The <a class="article-links" href="https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/" target="_blank">Four Tendencies Quiz</a> that I discovered, places me as a Questioner. As mentioned in earlier blogs this means “I do what I think is best, according to my judgment. If it doesn’t make sense, I won’t do it.” On reflection, I can see it’s possible that some of my procrastination comes from the fact I haven’t found a way to understand why I should do something and therefore am not motivated to meet that expectation. Understanding this tendency has shown me that if I am sensing some procrastination, perhaps I should ask more questions about the task I am procrastinating on, to find the reasons that will then justify to me personally that the task is worthwhile. Ideally, I will then be more motivated to complete the task and meet the expectation.

            I also learned I really dislike writing for an ‘audience’. It almost gives me a weird form of performance anxiety, half my brain shuts down because I’m worried about how the words will translate if anyone else reads it and I end up with a very poorly written end product.
      </p>

      <p>
            Lastly, I understand the principles and benefits of a growth mindset, but changing my brain to embrace challenge and sometimes failure - that’s something I will have to keep working on. A classic saying from my dad is: “A is not acceptable, A+ is ok”.
            I need to be intentional about retraining my mind to be ok with not being good at something and trying it anyway. AKA a C might be ok!

            <h3>What is the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      </p>

      <p>
            Understanding your own values helps recognise when others might be living to other values - which is more than ok. It also helps you recognise when you feel uncomfortable why that might be, you might be engaging in something that doesn’t align with who you really are. 
      </p>

      <p>
            Empathy to me is crucial in life. Specifically in programming, we need to constantly give and receive feedback which can go really badly if you don’t practice empathy for where someone else is coming from. It also means we can build better things, having empathy for the end users, as we build something, can only help create a more meaningful product that really suits the needs of those it was built for.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      </p>

      <p>
            How much I really like doing guided meditations. I did not think it would be something I’d enjoy but I really do. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      </p>
      
      <p>
            To be honest I think giving the core learning the time it’s worth was a challenge. I sometimes wanted to rush through those parts as I feel more confident with those skills than I do the technical skills. So making sure I stayed open minded to really learn about myself and areas for improvement during the core skills section was something I tried to be mindful of. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      </p>

      <p>
            To encourage us to recognise there are many skills involved in ‘being a good developer’, far beyond simply understanding code. Help us grow self awareness to better deal with the challenges of the course and career. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      </p>

      <p>
            No it doesn’t feel like a waste of time. I think if we get the opportunity to discuss the core ideas further in small groups during bootcamp it would help the ideas to sink in and feel more real. There is a risk that I enjoy thinking about the general ideas at the time, but that I revert to old habits quickly if not regularly going back over some of it. For me the importance at the moment seems more holistic, it’s less important that I can define to you exactly what EQ is, than that I realise there are many skills relevant to being an effective programmer.
