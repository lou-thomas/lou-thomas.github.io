         Friend: <i>"Hey hows your studies going?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Me: <i>"Yea great thanks. Well, it was all good, until we started learning about Javascript"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Friend: <i>"Oh well, I'm sure you'll get there"</i>

        Me: <i>"I mean, since you asked..."</i>

    <h3>Getting blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        So I feel like this was me all week. For a specific example though, earlier we were asked to use a `for...of` loop to achieve something. After reading the docs available for this I gave it a crack and was fairly certain I was close. I was not getting the result I needed though. I actually reached out to a colleague who is being uber supportive of my EDA journey. In the process of asking them I typed out where I was at and the specific bit I was stuck at. My text was<i>"I feel like maybe Iâ€™m asking for the return too soon?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as I'd typed this out I was like hmm, if that's what you think, try it somewhere else. Sure enough, moving the `return` to the right place got me the result I was looking for. In the meantime my colleague had asked me that exact question<i>"Where would you move the return to if you thought this?"</i> She really is a wonderful rubber duck!
    </p>
    <h3>Solving a problem in an elegant way</h3>
    <p>
        Unfortunately I really wouldn't use the term elegant for any of my work so far. In one challenge I could see that there were a couple of approaches that could be used. One was slightly more simple. The other meant writing the code in a way that allowed it to be more flexible in future and would be more elegant. In the end I needed to take the more simple approach as I was too blocked trying out the more dynamic approach. I could see how the more elegant approach would have benefits, and got halfway there but this remains an aspiration for future. 
    </p>
    <h3>Techniques</h3>
    <p>
        In both these exmaples and all throughout the week I have been using everything within my powers to make progress. Something I'm familiar and very comfortable with, is rubber ducking. Just the process of sorting out my thoughts in a way that means I can express them to someone else, to then pose a question, is often enough to help me get to the next step. I'm forced to articulate where I'm stuck and often unstick myself doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Error messsages are also great. I am learning to be friends with error messages. Even the annoying little underlines in my text editor are actually incredibly handy and specific at times. Another bestie of mine for sure is Google. Seriously I can't imagine learning coding without it and I really take my hat off to the early pioneers as well as those who contribute to the endless resources that are now available online.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Two techniques I am not so cosy with yet would be pseudocode and reflection. I might be able to reduce the amount of rubber ducking I do (sometimes I literally just talk outloud to myself) if I became better at pseudocoding. It would also benefit me if I get interrupted or need to take a break working on something. If I have some plain English sentences about my planned steps, it should be much easier to pick up where I left off.
    </p>
    <p>
         Similarly, reflection as a way of cementing what I've learnt should be a practice I aim to improve at. I have a feeling so far that I've been getting through the challenges, some with more ease than others, but that if you asked me to do something I just completed a few days ago,  I would have to start from scratch again. Am I really learning and understanding the methods/concepts or am I just doing enough to 'pass'? By reflecting each day or even at the end of a challenge and forcing myself to take better notes I think I would feel more accomplished and have a resource I could use when I come across similar problems.
