    <!-- 
An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).
Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
Explain what functions are and why they are useful. -->

      <h1>HTML, CSS, JS and last but not least, the mighty DOM.</h1>

      <h3>HTML and CSS - in the animal kingdom</h3>
      <p> If we wanted to David Attenborough up in here for a mo, we might liken HTML to a millipede.  Everyone of those endless legs are in just the right place to make the whole animal make sense and move forward. It's structure is very important, although all those legs are not really made for running, just slithering at a steady pace. CSS however would be more like a leopard. Much faster than HTML and who can deny that leopard print is not the ultimate in fashion and style. When CSS is in town, everyone's gonna be looking their best.
