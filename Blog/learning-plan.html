    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
    <u>Long term goals or career path</u>
    </div>
    <p>I'm honestly not entirely sure where I want this to take me. I do know that so far I'm really enjoying learning and I think I'd like to start out as a junior developer and see how it feels to be paid to do this! So very short term I want to succeed at EDA. From there I want to put the skills to use in a work context. After some experience hopefully I will still enjoy it and be confident enough to be in a position where I am mixing my coding/technical skills with my social values. I think that the satisfaction of developing will only last in the long run, if I believe in the end result. Essentially the Why.</p>
    <p>Dare I put in writing that actually I want it all. The fulfilling career where I am challenged and feel like I'm making a difference and being paid nicely for it. Plus the flexibility or worklife balance to live in Greece and spend afternoons eating grapes in the sun.</p>
    <div>
      <u>Things that will hold me up or make me better at learning</u>
    </div>
    <p>First up I'm concerned about my habit of procrastination. I have found it useful so far to timebox but I need to get stricter. I will continue to look at the current time when I start a challenge and work out when I should be finished or when I am going to stop for a break. Write it down and stick to it. Use alarms.</p>

    <p>It's almost been a good thing that I am working part time during Foundations as not having a full day for study forces me to be focussed during the time I do have. I will aim to take this as a positive lesson. During bootcamp I will try to keep a reasonable amount of time for the important things such as personal commitments and exercise. Rather than giving myself a whole evening to sttudy for example, actually setting the time aside to go out for a walk with a friend will benefit me for the fresh air but also as long as it's planned, I can factor that in to the available hours I have that day and use it to keep me focussed (read scared of getting behind).</p>
    <p>I suspect my age and general life experience will help me deal with the stress, with knowing when to speak up and putting things in perspective. Mind you it's been a while since I really put myself out there and took on something as new and challenging as this so I hope I really do ask for help when I think I will. I naturally enjoy supporting others so hopefully that becomes reciprocal and I can accept the help when needed.</p>

    <div>
      <u>How I'll work with peers and facilitators and the EDA community</u>
    </div>
    <p>From a facilitator I ask for honest feedback and if need be, a fairly tough or direct approach if I'm falling behind.I will do what works best for me which is taking some time to consider feedback before acting or responding to it.</p>
    <p>I really value community and believe a lot can be achieved when people have a sense of belonging so I will do my best to nurture that side of the experience as well. This looks like participating in slack conversations, being prepared to be a little vulnerable if I am stuck and always acting with respect for each other</p>
    
    <div>
      <u>Non tech skills</u>
    </div>
    <p>It has been really energising learning stuff these last 2 weeks and I think part of what I want to take away is firstly the passion for learning, secondly the skills for focussed learning, taking good notes instead of only being in the moment learning. I think to be a good developer you do need to keep up to date and be willing to try new things. I hope I can hone skills of extra curricular learning to do this instead of just sticking to what's needed on the day.</p>
