      Learning Plan - Bootcamp edition 7/3/2022
    </h1>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</h3>

    <p>
          My answer remains essentially the same here as it was 5 weeks ago. I wrote this before re-reading my original thoughts. I don’t think there is much difference.<br>
          I would like to become a junior developer and really give it a crack building on the EDA skills. I’m probably in a bit of a unique position in that I still have a job that I will be on leave from for the duration of bootcamp. So I already know in the short term I will be returning to work as a tester, but aiming to move more into development quickly. I am quite aligned with the purpose of my current organisation so I’d love to be able to contribute more there. If/when things change I just want to ensure I’m working on projects I believe in. I want my work to align with my values and to feel that I’m listened to when I share my thoughts. I want to be supported and have the opportunity to support those I work with too. I’m quite interested in helping others so a place that encourages collaboration is great. 
    </p>


    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
              Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h3>

    <p>
          I still hope I am someone that can be good at helping others. Even when I have been feeling a sense of failure in my own work during Foundations, I still wanted to help anyone else who is asking for help. Even if I don’t know the answer, being there for moral support. 
    </p>

    <p>
          I have been genuinely enjoying the material so far, I am less worried about procrastination as a weakness now, more so just keeping up with the pace. I don’t think I’m very fast at completing challenges so I think a weakness will be speed. Or lack of.
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
            While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this Plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.</h3>

    <p>
          As mentioned above, I do think a real challenge for me will be keeping up with the material. As a follow on from that,  because I will likely need to spend every waking hour on EDA, then also maintaining balance and not burning out will be the secondary challenge.
    </p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?</h3>

    <p>
    Time management is always going to be something I need to continuously work on. Possibly improving my reflective skills. I can be a bit of an over-thinker at times, but this tends to mean I naturally reflect on things that didn’t go so well. It wouldn’t hurt to reflect on things that do go well and intentionally notice what factors contributed to that. Including reflecting on learning in general.
  </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
    What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is useful to voice these expectations.</h3>

    <p>
          Listening and offering practical advice if I’m feeling behind. 
          Encouragement and recognition if I do well. Honest feedback when I need it. Hopefully throwing in some humour. Everything's better with a joke, no matter how bad it is. 
    </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
            Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
            Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>

    <p>
          I could try a self check in once a week - am I on track? If not, where do I need to spend my time. Do I need to raise it with anyone. Do I really understand all the material we’ve covered, do I need to do additional practice or reach out to others? Part of this will be to trust my gut on how I’m feeling and communicate when needed. If it’s a feeling of struggle, I am much more likely to opt for one on one style of communication. 
      </p>  

      <p>
            I also want to seek feedback from facilitators and peers about my own contribution. Overall am I adding a positive contribution, whether that is leading by example and being openly vulnerable when I need help. Or being able to offer support to others. It’s important to me to get the most of this experience for myself but to do that in a way that ideally helps others do the same. <br>
            Whilst this venture is really really important to me, I also want to remember to make it fun. That will be as good a reason as any to ask sooner than later if I need help, why waste any time being blocked on code or blocked mentally. 
      </p>

    <h3>
      Long term goals or career path
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm honestly not sure exactly where I want this to take me. I do know that so far I'm loving the learning. My loose plan is to start out as a junior developer and see how it feels to be working in development. So in the very short term I want to succeed at EDA. From there I want to put the skills to use in a work context. After some experience hopefully I will still enjoy it and be confident enough to be in a position where I am mixing my coding/technical skills with my social values. I think that the satisfaction of developing will only last in the long run, if I believe in the end result. Essentially the Why. I don't want to be just coding for the sake of it if I don't feel that I'm contributing to solving problems I care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dare I put in writing that actually I want it all. The fulfilling career where I am challenged and feel like I'm making a difference AND being paid comfortably for it. Plus the flexibility or work life balance...picture living in Greece and spending afternoons eating grapes in the Mediterranean sun.
    </p>
  
    <h3>
      Things that will hold me up or make me better at learning.
    </h3>
    <p>
      First up I'm concerned about my habit of procrastination. I have found it useful so far to timebox but I need to get stricter. I will continue to look at the current time when I start a challenge and work out when I should be finished or when I am going to stop for a break. Write it down and stick to it. Use alarms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspect my age and general life experience will help me deal with the stress, with knowing when to speak up and putting things in perspective. Mind you it's been a while since I really put myself out there and took on something as new and challenging as this so I hope I really do ask for help when I think I will. I naturally enjoy supporting others, so hopefully that becomes reciprocal and I can accept the help when needed. Here are two articles that I have decided to follow to help me know

      and <a class="article-links" href="https://codewithoutrules.com/2017/12/07/asking-for-help/" target="_blank">how</a> 
      to ask for help.
    </p>

    <h3>
      A commitment to how I will manage the workload in this programme
    </h3>
    <p>
      As above I commit to mapping out my available time and using strict timeboxing to achieve what needs to be done. When I feel that I'm falling behind I will accept that I have to skip the stretch material and come back to it if I finish early. I am dedicated to this course as my top priority and I will use my self discipline to stay on top of the workload. If things are building up, I will share this with the facilitators and listen to their advice. They have supported numerous students through this experience so my challenges will surely not be unique. I ask them to help me work out which things are priority if I can't manage everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Foundations I am also committed to working 12 hours across Monday, Wednesday and Friday in my job. When bootcamp starts I will no longer have this commitment. Other than the odd personal appointment, I do not expect to have any block-out or scheduling requirements during the day. I will be playing sport and attempting to get exercise several evenings a week. If we are doing team work and we want to work late, I will always communicate with my peers about the hours I won't be available for those evenings. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        How I'll work with peers, facilitators and the EDA community.
    </h3>

    <p>
      From a facilitator I ask for honest feedback and if need be, a fairly tough or direct approach if I'm falling behind. I will do what works best for me, which is taking some time to consider feedback before acting or responding to it. My commitment in return is to honour that feedback and keep acting with an open mind. I trust that everyone is there to support each other and I want to ensure people feel safe, comfortable and ideally enjoy working with me. To achieve this I will actively listen in group exercises and allow space for people to let me know if there is anything they are uncomfortable with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really value community and believe a lot can be achieved when people have a sense of belonging so I will do my best to nurture that side of the experience as well and get to know my fellow students. This looks like participating in slack conversations, being prepared to be a little vulnerable if I am stuck and always acting with respect for each other.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Non tech skills
    </h3>
  
    <p>
      It has been really energising learning stuff these last 2 weeks and I think part of what I want to take away is firstly the passion for learning, secondly the skills for focussed learning, taking good notes instead of only being in the moment learning. I think to be a good developer you do need to keep up to date and be willing to try new things. I hope I can hone skills of extra curricular learning to do this instead of just sticking to what's needed on the day.
