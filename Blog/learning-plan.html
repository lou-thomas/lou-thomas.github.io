      Learning Plan
    </h1>
  
    <h3>
      Long term goals or career path
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm honestly not sure exactly where I want this to take me. I do know that so far I'm loving the learning. My loose plan is to start out as a junior developer and see how it feels to be working in development. So in the very short term I want to succeed at EDA. From there I want to put the skills to use in a work context. After some experience hopefully I will still enjoy it and be confident enough to be in a position where I am mixing my coding/technical skills with my social values. I think that the satisfaction of developing will only last in the long run, if I believe in the end result. Essentially the Why. I don't want to be just coding for the sake of it if I don't feel that I'm contributing to solving problems I care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dare I put in writing that actually I want it all. The fulfilling career where I am challenged and feel like I'm making a difference AND being paid comfortably for it. Plus the flexibility or work life balance...picture living in Greece and spending afternoons eating grapes in the Mediterranean sun.
    </p>
  
    <h3>
      Things that will hold me up or make me better at learning.
    </h3>
    <p>
      First up I'm concerned about my habit of procrastination. I have found it useful so far to timebox but I need to get stricter. I will continue to look at the current time when I start a challenge and work out when I should be finished or when I am going to stop for a break. Write it down and stick to it. Use alarms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspect my age and general life experience will help me deal with the stress, with knowing when to speak up and putting things in perspective. Mind you it's been a while since I really put myself out there and took on something as new and challenging as this so I hope I really do ask for help when I think I will. I naturally enjoy supporting others, so hopefully that becomes reciprocal and I can accept the help when needed. Here are two articles that I have decided to follow to help me know

      to ask for help.

    <h3>
      A commitment to how I will manage the workload in this programme
    </h3>
    <p>
      As above I commit to mapping out my available time and using strict timeboxing to achieve what needs to be done. When I feel that I'm falling behind I will accept that I have to skip the stretch material and come back to it if I finish early. I am dedicated to this course as my top priority and I will use my self discipline to stay on top of the workload. If things are building up, I will share this with the facilitators and listen to their advice. They have supported numerous students through this experience so my challenges will surely not be unique. I ask them to help me work out which things are priority if I can't manage everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Foundations I am also committed to working 12 hours across Monday, Wednesday and Friday in my job. When bootcamp starts I will no longer have this commitment. Other than the odd personal appointment, I do not expect to have any block-out or scheduling requirements during the day. I will be playing sport and attempting to get exercise several evenings a week. If we are doing team work and we want to work late, I will always communicate with my peers about the hours I won't be available for those evenings. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        How I'll work with peers, facilitators and the EDA community.
    </h3>

    <p>
      From a facilitator I ask for honest feedback and if need be, a fairly tough or direct approach if I'm falling behind. I will do what works best for me, which is taking some time to consider feedback before acting or responding to it. My commitment in return is to honour that feedback and keep acting with an open mind. I trust that everyone is there to support each other and I want to ensure people feel safe, comfortable and ideally enjoy working with me. To achieve this I will actively listen in group exercises and allow space for people to let me know if there is anything they are uncomfortable with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really value community and believe a lot can be achieved when people have a sense of belonging so I will do my best to nurture that side of the experience as well and get to know my fellow students. This looks like participating in slack conversations, being prepared to be a little vulnerable if I am stuck and always acting with respect for each other.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Non tech skills
    </h3>
  
    <p>
      It has been really energising learning stuff these last 2 weeks and I think part of what I want to take away is firstly the passion for learning, secondly the skills for focussed learning, taking good notes instead of only being in the moment learning. I think to be a good developer you do need to keep up to date and be willing to try new things. I hope I can hone skills of extra curricular learning to do this instead of just sticking to what's needed on the day.
