        <h2>Personal Values</h2>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Equality</li>
            <li>Honesty and integrity</li>
            <li>Kindness</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
        I love the outdoors, summer is really my jam. ☀️
        </p>
        <p>I can get a lil fired up pretty quickly in conversations where I feel a person or group isn't being given a fair chance.
        </p>
        <p>For any Anne of Green Gables fans out there, I pretty much live by this quote "Cheaters never prosper Anne Shirley." It might be lame but I genuinely believe honesty is the best policy and will let you sleep at night.
        </p>
        <p>I read on someone else's blog (credit Halmai!) that empathy can help so many people in their challenging times. I'd much rather improve someone's day than the opposite, and if all it takes is a little understanding and kindness then that's what I want to bring.
        </p>
        
        <!-- <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>

        yea I really struggled to recall an example where I felt ethically challenged. I know my decision to move back to NZ from Taiwan had a lot to do with a combination of my values but I don't have the skills to express that in a fair way -->

      <h2>How your culture has influenced your values and identity?</h2> 
          <p> My culture has influenced my value of independence and variety- it's so common for Kiwis to want to go out and explore the world. I think we sit here at the 'bottom' of the world and for me I didn't get the opportunity to go anywhere else untill I was an adult so by then I was bursting with curiosity about other places and lives. The great OE is such a common concept here but not so in other cultures.
          </p>
          <p>I value personal freedom combined with trust and respect. I've been fortunate enough as a Pakeha to grow up under systems and governments that overall I trust. Plus a culture that doesn't require 100% conformity. 
            I love the outdoors and I have a sense of resilience - as mum puts it - quiet determination - I think that is a little bit the Kiwi psyche, we are quiet about our achievements but we do strive to find our place in the world.

        <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
        </h2>
        <p></p>
          <u>Strengths</u>
        <p>
          Seeing as it's not natural for me to talk about strenghts I will blatantly copy paste from what the internet told me about myself on various quizzes and guides...
        </p>
        <p> - Social/Equality value
          "Individuals with social values tend to be good communicators. They relate well to others and use these skills best in the helping professions". Yep I'd say I usually get on well with most people/colleagues and others have noted that I'm a good communicator. 
        </p>

        <p>Intellectual creativity</p>
          <p>When it comes to work projects, you thrive best when you have balance. Sometimes, you want to put your creativity into action and tackle projects that require you to generate new ideas and solutions, or take a unique, out-of-the box approach. Other times, you prefer to work on tasks that are more straightforward. You would be an asset in a variety of work environments, as you have the advantage of being both practical and creative.
          </p>

          <u>Challenges</u>
          <p>I really do get analysis paralysis and I could use these strategies to help myself
          </p>
          <p>Use deadlines, limits, trusted authority, and always an appeal to
            efficiency. Questioners can meet unjustified expectations by finding their own
            justification. For example I might think it's unnecessary to have a shopping list but I know it helps my partner so I will do it for his sake.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
        
          <p>Social values will help me get along with others and ask the questions I need help with.</p>
          <p>
          Being a <a href="../styles/images/questioner-Report.pdf">Questioner,</a> if I don't personally believe in something it will slow me down or prevent me from achieving that thing.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2> 
          <p>There has occassionaly been tension at work when someone has displayed immaturity and managed to offend others and myself, despite having a heart in the right place. Initial strategy was to recognise that any sense of disharmony can really affect my mood and sense of calm/focus. So I removed myself and didn't get involved. Eventually I reached out to a trusted person and they could validate I wasn't the only one feeling that way. They were brave enough to try to help the person understant what had happened. I'd like to get to a place where I am both confident and skilful enough to do the same. Particularly when I feel the person is willing to change/grow/be the best they can be.
