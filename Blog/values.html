        I love the outdoors, summer is really my jam. ☀️
        </p>
        <p>
          I can get a lil fired up pretty quickly in conversations where I feel a person or group isn't being given a fair chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any Anne of Green Gables fans out there, I pretty much live by this quote "Cheaters never prosper Anne Shirley." It might be lame but I genuinely believe honesty is the best policy and will let you sleep at night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I read on someone else's blog (credit Halmai!) that empathy can help so many people in their challenging times. I'd much rather improve someone's day than the opposite, and if all it takes is a little understanding and kindness then that's what I want to bring.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
        </h3>

        <p>
          I actually really struggled to think of an ethical decision here. I assume I have had to make such decisions throughout life but there isn't anything I remember getting stuck on.  I'll borrow a situation from my sister since I didn't hold back on giving my opinion of what she should do in this case. She had a small car accident and the other driver was at fault. Unfortunately at the time neither of them had relevant insurance. The other driver did all the right things though and offered to give her cash for damages. She initially got a quote which was X amount for repairs, and the other driver made the payment. Then when she actually went to do the repairs she took it to a different garage who said they could do it for much less. She was considering pocketing the difference, 'as compensation for the inconveniences of the crash'. I felt sorry this had happened to her but in this case I felt very strongly that she should not end up benefiting from it. The other driver had done the right thing to offer payment without any resistance, she should 100% return any extra money that she didn't end up spending on repairs. This called into play my values of honesty and integrity. I believe my sister would have done the right thing in the end but called me to ask, knowing the kind of response I would give. In moments of frustration she has called me too righteous 😅, but in calmer moments she has said she respects my sense of integrity. 
          Another easy check I've used in the past, is whether or not I'd tell my parents about my choices. If not, that's a pretty good indicator you might not be making the most ethical one.

      <h3>
        How has your culture has influenced your values and identity?
      </h3> 
          <p>
            My culture has probably influenced my value of independence and variety- it's so common for Kiwis to want to go out and explore the world. I think we sit here at the 'bottom' of the earth feeling so far away from everything. By the time I could finally go traveling in my 20's I was bursting with curiosity about other places and lives. The great OE is such a common concept here but in other cultures it can be seen as a waste of time when you should be working on your career and staying safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a sense of humility and resilience, or as Mum puts it, quiet determination. I think that is a little bit the Kiwi psyche, we are quiet about our achievements but we do strive to find our place in the world.

          <u>Strengths</u>
        <p>
          Seeing as it's not natural for me to talk about my strengths, I will blatantly copy paste from what the internet told me about myself on various quizzes and guides...
        </p>
        <p> - Social/Equality value
          "Individuals with social values tend to be good communicators. They relate well to others and use these skills best in the helping professions." Yep I'd say I usually get on well with most people/colleagues and others have noted that I'm a good communicator. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Intellectual creativity
        </p>
          <p>
            "When it comes to work projects, you thrive best when you have balance. Sometimes, you want to put your creativity into action and tackle projects that require you to generate new ideas and solutions, or take a unique, out-of-the box approach. Other times, you prefer to work on tasks that are more straightforward. You would be an asset in a variety of work environments, as you have the advantage of being both practical and creative." Again this does resonate, I like detailed work that others might find boring but I also enjoy the bigger picture discussions.
          </p>

          <u>Challenges</u>
          <p>
            I really do get analysis paralysis and I could use the following strategies to help myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Use deadlines, limits, a trusted authority, and always an appeal to efficiency. <a href="../styles/images/questioner-Report.pdf">Questioners,</a> can meet unjustified expectations by finding their own justification. For example I might think it's unnecessary to have a shopping list since I can do mental work in my head at the shop. But I know it helps my partner so I will do it for his sake and to avoid arguments such as 'why did you forget to buy bread'.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.

          <p>
            Social values will help me get along with others and ask the questions I need help with.
          </p>
          <p>
          Being a <a href="../styles/images/questioner-Report.pdf">Questioner,</a> if I don't personally believe in something it will slow me down or prevent me from achieving that thing.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
          </h3> 
          <p>
            There was occasionally tension at a previous workplace when someone managed to offend others and myself, despite having a heart in the right place. Her style of communication or choice of words wasn't the best. My initial strategy was to recognise that any sense of disharmony can really affect my mood and sense of calm/focus. So I distanced myself from the conversation and didn't get involved so I could continue to focus on my work and not make any knee-jerk reaction. Once I'd had time to reflect I reached out to a trusted person and they could validate I wasn't the only one feeling that way. The person that I reached out to, was brave enough to try to help the original person understand what had happened. I'd like to get to a place where I am both confident and skillful enough to bring up issues and try to help someone understand the impact of their actions, rather than just avoid the problem. Particularly when I feel the person is willing to change or grow.
