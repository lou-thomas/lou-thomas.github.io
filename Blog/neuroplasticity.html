      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    
      <p>
              Neuroplasticity = the ability of the brain to modify its connections or rewire itself. 
      </p>

      <p>
              Without this ability, we wouldn't be able to develop from infancy to adulthood or recover from brain injury.
      </p>

      <p>
              Scientists have proven that when we learn something new, we can make new connections up there in those noggins of ours. Better yet, the more you practice the thing you just learned, the stronger that ole noggin connection gets.
      </p>

      <p>
              Cool, so I’ve just spent hours learning a new javascript trick, aka building a new JS wire in my brain. You’re telling me if I put it into practice a few times, I’m actually giving that JS wire a lifetime guarantee?! Well maybe not lifetime, but for sure, the more you practice the stronger it gets and much less likely you’ll need to go back to the shop for a refund. Well that's good news!
      </p>

      <p>
              As an example of how plastic fantastic your mind can be. I'll very quickly tell you about a study in which participants who performed hand exercises, but <b>only using their minds,</b> were actually able to <b>increase the physical strength in their hands.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
              So whether you want to learn the lyrics to your favourite Eminem song so you can rap along with confidence next time at the party, or you want to unlearn that icecream is not a breakfast food, it’s all possible. Our brains are ready and waiting for us to fire up new pathways and tread them till the cows come home. 
      </p>
        
        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        
      <p>
              Back to scientists, I think in general they are a great bunch of people to help us think about a growth mindset. Scientists start out with an idea or a problem that they don’t know anything about. For some of us, that’s a nightmare. "I don’t know anything about xyz, I can’t help you sorry." But for a scientist, not knowing is exciting. They’re going to take a guess at what a possible answer could be (a guess, how wild!) Then they’re going to see if they were right or completely wrong. It doesn’t matter to them if they’re right or not, what’s exciting is that they’re going to find out something new. Even if it takes 1000 hours in a lab, they’re happy to do it because they love the process of discovery and they know they have the tools and methodologies to try things out. 
        </p>

        <p>
                That is basically what a growth mindset is, being totally ok with not knowing, but being totally keen to find out. Realising that you might make incorrect assumptions along the way, but being willing to have a laugh and throw them out the window once you realise you were wrong. Also realising that you might not get the answer in a day, but if you just continue putting effort in, you will get there eventually, and you’ll be better off for all the new wires you’ve installed in that noggin along the way. 
      </p>

      <p>
              Even more good news! Congratulations, you’ve just unlocked two brilliant and proven options to improve your learning and your life. Simply by understanding both neuroplasticity and the concept of a growth mindset, you are more likely to benefit from them.
      </p>

      <p>
              Here are <a class="article-links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/neuroplasticity-three-easy-experiments-david-orban" target="_blank">3 fun mini experiments</a>you can try out yourself to see how plasticy your own mind might be!
      </p>
      <p>
              There are lots of takeaways from all this brain talk. Check out <a class="article-links" href="https://alexvermeer.com/15-benefits-growth-mindset/" target="_blank">this inspiring article</a> for some more good news. Three things I’d like to personally embed into my regular habits are:
      </p> 

      <p>
              1.) Starting to see single events as just that.
              A fixed mindset can cause you to measure your whole self-worth on single events or outcomes. Such as your French exam score, that time you failed your drivers licence test, or your regrettable fashion choices in your early 20’s. This is ridiculous. A growth mindset realises that these are single events that do not define you. You might turn out to be a pro formula one driver, who speaks French fluently and has their own fashion brand on the side! I want to remind myself if I feel like I didn't do so well on one challenge, this means I can try again and there is lots of room for improvement.
      </p>

      <p>
              2.) Once you realise that single events or first attempts at something do NOT define how good you will be at that thing forever, it also makes it easier to take risks and fail. Failure actually is just an opportunity to learn. I want to celebrate failure or, for baby steps, be open to the possibility of it. I sometimes tend towards perfectionism which actually just slows me down so much, I don't want to do or share anything that I don't consider close to perfect to the point where I will just give up. Instead I want to challenge myself to share things before I really feel ready, and see it as a great chance to get feedback that can help me grow.
      </p>

      <p>
              3.) Lastly, there is a really important word that can help me to remember the power of my own mind, Yet.
              I might not be a confident driver, YET. I may not have mastered the French accent, YET. I may not be a software developer YET. 
              But the best is yet to come.
